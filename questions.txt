1. The general trend in the curve is similair to a logarithmic funtion or an exponential function with a horizontal asymptote. The accuracy starts out right around guessing percentage and then increases towards 100 percent as the percentage of data used for training increases. 
2. The middle of this plot seems to be nosier than the rest of it. The outsides of the curve will be fairly consistent. At low training values, the computer will be guessing, and will have a low success rate. At high values the computer will have a fairly high success rate. Both of these will be fairly consistent. In the middle, however, the values will be fairly inconsistent. In some trials, the machine will have learned enough to be fairly succesful, and in other trials it will not have. This will provide a lot of variation and make noise.
3. Once you reach 100 trials the graph starts to straighten out. It can be made much straighter though. For example a plot with ranges 1-99 and 300 trials can be made. This provides a very smooth graph.
4. Increasing the c value makes the program run a lot more slowly. However, it also makes the program much more accurate when using the same percentage of data for training. The graph starts to look more like an exponential with a horizontal asymptote as you increase c
